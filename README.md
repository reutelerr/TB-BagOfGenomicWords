# TB-BagOfGenomicWords

## K-mer Counting

To use a "bag of words" approach, we build a dictionary of all the K-mers we find, 
as long as they have a minimum frequency

Commands :

Use "dictionary new <dictionaryName> <sourceFile>" to create a new dictionary
Use "dictionary filter <dictionaryName>" to filter out less frequent K-mers
